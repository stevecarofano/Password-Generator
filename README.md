# Password-Generator

## Description

* I wanted to make a password generator that allows the user to choose the criteria they want for their password

* The application isn't quite finished yet but you can see the general funcionality that it contains

* The user will be able to choose a password length and specify if they want lowercase, uppercase and special characters

* It has been a great challenge to prompt the user with this criteria and then include that criteria in the generated password

* In the future I will finish up the code in order to accurately generate password given the chosen criteria

## Usage

As I mentioned, this application isn't completely finished yet, but you can still try it out and see the general functionality
and very soon you will be able to generate your very own unique password!

Find the red Generate Password button at the bottom of the page:
    ![passGen](Assets/pass-gen.png)
    
Then click it to see a series of prompts about your password criteria:

This one asks the user what length they would like for the password:
    ![passLength](Assets/pass-gen-length.png)

This one (and the following prompts) ask the user to specify which character types they would like to include in the password:
    ![passCriteria](Assets/pass-gen-criteria.png)
